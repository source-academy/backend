Very relevant for our Studios, I feel.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nBest,<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n-martin<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;\\r\\n<h3>The Coach Who Was a Teacher</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>By Larry Spence, Penn State University</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I walked in the first day of class wearing a ball cap, whistle, and clipboard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your coach. Your performance is the focus. My job is to help you get better. We&rsquo;re going to learn to think critically and creatively about the toughest problems in political science.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Horror tugged at every face in the room. I hurried into the opening exercise of the class&mdash;to discuss elements of the students&rsquo; best learning experiences. I took off the hat, put the whistle in my pocket, and shed the clipboard. Even so, at the end of the class two students approached, wondering if maybe they should drop.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So much for being a guide on the side, I thought. And yet coaching seemed like the best metaphor to describe the way I wanted to teach. What were the best coaching practices? I questioned colleagues in the kinesiology department and wasn&rsquo;t happy with their answers that scattered between providing therapy, yelling, motivating, and delivering sermons.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Then I stumbled on to the obvious: John Wooden, a basketball legend who&rsquo;s considered the best coach of the twentieth century. Wooden won 10 national basketball championships for UCLA and a record 88 consecutive games. Two education researchers observed his practices in his last (1974-75) season. The sessions were exactingly choreographed and loaded with terse information. There were no pep talks or elaborate praise. The coach never mentioned winning.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Wooden thought coaching was teaching. His method was to present a model performance, observe how players performed, and then intervene to highlight errors and show ways to correct them. His teaching started with carefully planned practices. He kept track how warm ups, demonstrations, corrections, and exercises worked. Reading about his diligence put me to shame. What seemed like small stuff&mdash;scheduling, timing, pace, even the correct way to wear socks&mdash; were major to him.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>During practice Wooden emphasized repetition with variations in resistance and intensity. His model was to demonstrate, then practice, practice, and practice. He called this a part/whole design. You first introduce the whole context of a play; break it down into skills to be practiced, and then recombine the parts in a scrimmage.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As for how he interacted with his players, always the perfectionist, he corrected every mistake quickly. He addressed the act, not the actor. Players were kept focused on improvement rather than rewards. He did not strive to avoid errors but exploited them as clues to players&rsquo; misconceptions. When a player mastered a skill he raised the pressure or assigned a new skill. The goal was for players to think and have options to improvise. For his players, practices were harder than the games.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The researchers found that 75% of his comments were information about how to do something or how to improve it. On average, the comments lasted less than 20 seconds. He did not say, &ldquo;Good job&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad job.&rdquo; He did not go in for elaborate explanations. His attention was on the little steps that lead to improvement.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>He dealt with players individually, working to deliver instruction when it would produce learning. Successful coaching depends on knowing the limits and capacities of each player. &ldquo;The most unfair thing to do is to treat everyone the same,&rdquo; he observed. Wooden was shocked when a faculty colleague told him, teachers present knowledge; it&rsquo;s the students&rsquo; job to get it. He believed the opposite. If students haven&rsquo;t learned, then the teacher hasn&rsquo;t taught.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our classrooms are a long way from Wooden&rsquo;s practices. But shouldn&rsquo;t they be more alike? Shouldn&rsquo;t they be learning spaces where students can try, fail, and be instructed? What I learned from the Coach was the necessity for a teacher to enter the learners&rsquo; experience. I needed to observe and listen until I knew their strengths, weaknesses, and uniqueness. That requires intense work, but doesn&rsquo;t it reflect the duties of our profession?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When he died on June 4, 2010, commentators recounted Wooden&rsquo;s incomparable records and his impact on those he coached. Renowned for modesty and dedication to his principles, Wooden seemed a wizard to most. But to me he was a teacher; maybe the best.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ndash;from the November 2010 issue of&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Teaching Professor.</em></p>\\r\\n\",\"Url\":\"\",\"ExpiryDate\":\"\\/Date(1539331860000+0800)\\/\",\"ExpiryDate_js\":\"2018-10-12T16:11:00\",\"CreatedDate\":\"\\/Date(1528964160000+0800)\\/\",\"CreatedDate_js\":\"2018-06-14T16:16:00\",\"Creator\":{\"UserID\":\"dcsmjh\",\"Name\":\"Martin Henz\",\"Email\":\"henz@comp.nus.edu.sg\",\"Title\":null,\"UserGuid\":\"4dce39fc-432c-4e4c-aef1-8bb187fcbcc0\",\"AccountType\":null,\"Photo\":null},\"isRead\":false,\"CourseCode\":null,\"CourseName\":null},{\"ID\":\"ac68877a-5d4b-4dc2-ad05-e24f560a2750\",\"Title\":\"The Silent Game\",\"Description\":\"Hi Folks:<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nJust came across this technique that you might want to consider for your Studio sessions.

Brookfield and Stephen Preskill.\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Structured Silence</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A crucial element in a conversational rhythm is silence. Yet lulls in a discussion are often experienced as awkward and interpreted to mean that nothing is happening.&nbsp;<em>Structured Silence&nbsp;</em>is a way to help people become comfortable with silence as an integral part of any discussion session.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Purposes&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*To embed periods of silence in discussions so that participants feel comfortable during those lulls.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*To keep discussion grounded and focused by introducing regular opportunities for people to identify important points and new questions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*To give those who have not contributed an opportunity to shape the conversation .</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>How It Works&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*Every fifteen minutes or so the facilitator asks people to pause for two to three minutes to think about a question that they or another person has posed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*Examples of questions we often ask are &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the most important point that&rsquo;s been made so far today?&rdquo; &ldquo;What questions have been raised for you in the discussion up to now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Which of your assumptions about the topic have been confirmed and which have been challenged in the last twenty minutes?&rdquo; &ldquo;What important perspectives are we missing?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so confusing or puzzling that we need to revisit it?&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*During this pause, participants write down their responses to the question on 3&rsquo; x 5&rsquo; cards. Alternatively, they post their thoughts on&nbsp;<em>Today&rsquo;s Meet&nbsp;</em>(Technique 5). Facilitators stress this is anonymous.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*After two or three minutes people pass their cards to the facilitator, who chooses several comments at random and shares these with the group. Alternatively, facilitators pull up the&nbsp;<em>Today&rsquo;s Meet</em>&nbsp;feed on the screen and invite people to comment on any responses that intrigue them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*Based on participant responses, the facilitator and group talk about where the discussion should go next.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Where and When It Works Well</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With quieter, more hesitant groups.&nbsp;People&rsquo;s natural silence is acknowledged as an important part of the discussion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With groups who tend to veer off in multiple directions.&nbsp;This helps a group stay focused on exploring the question at hand and deepening the discussion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With hierarchical groups.&nbsp;This is a good way to encourage contributions if a clear hierarchy exists in the group and quieter members are intimidated about saying something critical or suggesting a new direction.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What Users Appreciate</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Anonymity.&nbsp;Conducted properly, this exercise enables people to ask difficult questions, critique the leader, or admit to confusion without being identified.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It equalizes participation.&nbsp;Introverts and ESL speakers appreciate the chance to shape the course of the discussion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It grounds discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants report that stopping regularly to respond to a question helps keep the conversation focused on the topic.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Discussion develops organically.&nbsp;Instead of veering from one topic to the other, the conversation builds in an organic way, with regular references to earlier comments and contributions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What to Watch out For</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Discomfort with silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first couple of times you do this, you can play some quiet background instrumental music so that there is not total silence.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mistiming the silent pause.&nbsp;Sometimes a discussion is going so well that interrupting it with this exercise causes a loss of momentum and energy. At other times a crucial moment in a discussion is reached when people are grappling with a difficult issue or confronting a contradiction, so don&rsquo;t do this rigidly every fifteen minutes. Use your best judgement and ignore it when necessary.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Questions That Fit This Protocol</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Take note of the questions we often ask as prompts for&nbsp;<em>Structured Silence</em>&nbsp;in the &ldquo;How It Works&rdquo; section:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the most important point that&rsquo;s been made so far today?&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*&ldquo;What questions have been raised for you in the discussion up to now?&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*&ldquo;Which of your assumptions about the topic have been confirmed and which have been challenged in the last twenty minutes?&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*&ldquo;What important perspectives are we missing?&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so confusing or puzzling that we need to revisit it?&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\",\"Url\":\"\",\"ExpiryDate\":\"\\/Date(1538792100000+0800)\\/\",\"ExpiryDate_js\":\"2018-10-06T10:15:00\",\"CreatedDate\":\"\\/Date(1528424460000+0800)\\/\",\"CreatedDate_js\":\"2018-06-08T10:21:00\",\"Creator\":{\"UserID\":\"dcsmjh\",\"Name\":\"Martin Henz\",\"Email\":\"henz@comp.nus.edu.sg\",\"Title\":null,\"UserGuid\":\"4dce39fc-432c-4e4c-aef1-8bb187fcbcc0\",\"AccountType\":null,\"Photo\":null},\"isRead\":false,\"CourseCode\":null,\"CourseName\":null},{\"ID\":\"a575f29e-f9ef-4ad3-b2ca-1103e4213f97\",\"Title\":\"Active Learning Strategies\",\"Description\":\"Dear all:<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWelcome to the staff team of CS1101S.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nWe could use this IVLE announcement tool to share teaching-related information.

Active learning requires students to meaningfully interact with the course content, think about meaning, or investigate connections with their prior knowledge. Therefore, active learning can include a wide range of experiences and activities such as small group work, debates, problem-based learning, or large class discussions. Active learning is most effective when it involves more than one instructional strategy&mdash;rather than being expected to sit and listen, students are encouraged to think critically about the information, interact with others, share their thoughts, and create new ideas.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Every college student has attended many, many lectures because it&rsquo;s very common for instructors to communicate their knowledge to their students in this way. A lecture is often characterized by students passively listening and maybe taking notes. However, by incorporating questions and activities, you can easily involve students in a lecture, making it an active, student-centered experience.&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://go.unl.edu/wngr&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527667584974000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEna2MdzSecP14b5jPc2TVKV27jCw\\\" href=\\\"http://go.unl.edu/wngr\\\" id=\\\"m_3490829115535466156LPlnk694673\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">This video</a>&nbsp;shows examples of lectures that feature active learning. Note that the students are listening to the instructor, but also practicing problem-solving and teaching their fellow students</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Benefits of Active Learning</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Research has shown that active learning experiences improve student learning (e.g., Freeman et al., 2014; Prince, 2004). Something as simple as taking breaks every fifteen minutes during a lecture and allowing students to compare and discuss their notes can improve student comprehension and retention of lecture information (e.g., Ruhl, Hughes, &amp; Schloss, 1987; Ruhl, Hughes, &amp; Gajar, 1990). Allowing students to work on small group activities during class (e.g., Johnson, Johnson, &amp; Smith, 1998), participate in classroom discussions (e.g., Roehling et al., 2011), and solve problems (e.g., Davidson, Major, &amp; Michaelsen, 2014) are all examples of active learning strategies that are linked with increased academic achievement, such as improved quiz scores or higher course grades. These findings provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of active learning experiences and the need for instructors to incorporate these strategies into their classrooms when appropriate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition to these benefits to your students&#39; learning, many instructors find that students enjoy classes that incorporate active learning. Because active learning asks students to be involved in the class, these strategies can help them feel more engaged in class and more excited about participating in the class. Active learning can often be used to break up a lecture. Most students will struggle to focus on a 50-minute lecture with no interruption, however a short active learning activity can also be used to break up that lecture into more reasonable parts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Strategies for the Classroom</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Integrating active learning into your classroom doesn&#39;t need to take a lot of time or effort. Below are some strategies that instructors in all fields could implement in their classroom.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Think-Pair-Share</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Begin by posing a question to your students. The type of question you ask is important; one that requires considerable thought and reflection is best (as opposed to a simple knowledge question). Give your students sufficient time to THINK about their individual answer. You may want to ask them to write down some of their thoughts. Next, assign students to PAIR up with a fellow student to discuss answers from their notes. Finally, give student pairs a chance to SHARE their answers with the class. This technique can help students feel more comfortable participating, which increases discussion in your classroom. When more students share their thoughts about the content, you can assess how effective your instruction was for helping them understand the material.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Minute Paper</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Midway through a lecture or discussion, ask your students to write (or type) for one minute, summarizing what they&rsquo;ve learned so far. You can collect the resulting Minute Papers to assess if their learning is on track, or you can ask them to share their answer with their neighbor. It&#39;s also appropriate to conduct a Minute Paper exercise at the end of a lesson, either to summarize what they learned or to share with you what&rsquo;s still unclear. This variation is sometimes called a&nbsp;<em>Muddiest Point</em>. Using this technique allows you to assess the effectiveness of your classroom activities and identify topics which you may need to address.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Case Studies</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Case studies are situational stories used to show students how theories or concepts can be applied to real-world situations. Present small teams of students with a complex open-ended problem in your field that may have no clear solution. The situations typically start with &ldquo;What would you propose if...&rdquo; or &ldquo;How would you figure out...&rdquo; Ask the students to answer the question using the theories or concepts they&rsquo;ve learned about in class. You can give students the problem very early in the class period&mdash;in the absence of further information&mdash;and encourage them to identify the information they&rsquo;ll need to solve the problem. This type of approach requires more planning and preparation from the instructor to ensure the problem and other learning materials are sufficient for student success and that the exercise addresses the learning objectives of the course. Fortunately, many case studies are published in texts and online that you can adapt for your students.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jigsaw</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re starting a new unit of your course that features a multi-step process or multiple viewpoints your students should consider. Using a jigsaw activity helps students learn a topic and then teach one another with your guidance. Begin by assigning students into groups. Members of each group will be assigned to study one part of the larger lesson, discussing it within their group and learning all they can about it. Later that day or during the next class period, new groups are formed. Each new group has one member from each of the old groups. Each member then is responsible for teaching the new group members about what they have learned. This strategy is a form of&nbsp;<em>Peer Teaching</em>. Following the group work, you would conduct a brief lecture or lead a class discussion to review and integrate the main points, and address student questions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Choose a strategy that you feel comfortable with and that would make sense in your classroom and try it out.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>References</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Boswell, C.
