Predefined Runes include heart, circle, square, sail, rcross, nova, corner, and blank. You can access these Runes using their names. You can only use predeclared functions, including "show," "beside," "stack," "beside_frac," "stack_frack," "make_cross," "quarter_turn_left," "quarter_turn_right," "turn_upside_down." These functions are defined below:   1. [Function "show" renders the specified Rune in a tab as a basic drawing. Function prototype: show(rune: Rune): Rune Prototype Description: It takes a Rune parameter as input and returns the specified Rune. Example: "show(heart)" shows a heart shape rune.]   2. [Function "beside" makes a new Rune from two given Runes by placing the first on the left of the second, both occupying equal portions of the width of the result. Function prototype: beside(rune1: Rune, rune2: Rune): Rune  Prototype Description: It takes two parameters of type Rune, rune1 and rune2, as input and returns a Rune. Example 1: "beside(r1, r2)", places r1 on the left of the r2. Example 2: "beside(stack(r1, r2), stack(r3, r4))" places the output of stack(r1, r2) on the left of output of stack(r3, r4). ]   3. [Function "stack" makes a new Rune from two given Runes by placing the first one on top of the second one, each occupying equal parts of the height of the result. Function prototype: stack(rune1: Rune, rune2: Rune): Rune Prototype Description: It takes two parameters of type Rune, rune1 and rune2, as input and returns a Rune. Example1: "stack(r1, r2)" places r1 on top of r2. Example 2: "Stack(beside(r1, r2), beside(r3, r4))" places output of beside(r1, r2) on top of the output of beside(r3, r4).]   4. [Function "beside_frack" Makes a new Rune from two given Runes by placing the first on the left of the second such that the first one occupies a frac portion of the width of the result and the second the rest. Function Prototype: beside_frac(frac: number, rune1: Rune, rune2: Rune): Rune Prototype Description: It takes a number between 0 and 1 as "frac" and two parameters of type Rune, "rune1" and "rune2," as input and returns a Rune parameter. Example 1: "beside_frac(1/2, heart, circle) places a heart on the left of the circle, and both occupy 1/2 of the plane." Example 2: "beside_frac(1/4, heart, circle) places a heart on the left of the circle. The heart occupies 1/4 of the plane, and the circle occupies 3/4 of the plane."]   5. [Function "stack_frack" Makes a new Rune from two given Runes by placing the first on top of the second such that the first one occupies a frac portion of the height of the result and the second the rest. Function Prototype:stack_frac(frac: number, rune1: Rune, rune2: Rune): Rune Prototype Description: It takes a number between 0 and 1 as "frac" and two parameters of type Rune, "rune1" and "rune2," as input and returns a Rune parameter. Example 1: "stack_frac(1/2, heart, circle) places a heart on top of the circle, and both occupy 1/2 of the plane." Example 2: "stack_frac(1/4, heart, circle) places a heart on top of the circle. The heart occupies 1/4 of the plane, and the circle occupies 3/4 of the plane."]   6. [Function "make_cross" makes a new Rune from a given Rune by arranging it into a square for copies of the given Rune in different orientations. Function Prototype: make_cross(rune: Rune): Rune Prototype Description: It takes a Rune parameter as input and returns a Rune parameter. Example: "make_cross(heart)" places a heart shape rune on the bottom-left, a 90-degree clockwise rotated heart on the top-left, a 180-degree clockwise rotated heart on the top-right, and a 270-degree clockwise rotated heart on the bottom-right. The final Rune consists of four runes.]   7. [Function "quarter_turn_left" Makes a new Rune from a given Rune by turning it a quarter-turn in an anti-clockwise direction. Function prototype: quarter_turn_right(rune: Rune): Rune  Prototype Description: It takes a Rune parameter as input and returns a Rune parameter. Example 1: "quarter_turn_left(heart)" rotates the heart shape rune 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction. Example 2: "quarter_turn_left(stack(r1, r2))" rotates the output of stack(r1, r2) 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction. ]   8. [Function "quarter_turn_right" makes a new Rune from a given Rune by turning it a quarter-turn around the center in a clockwise direction. Function prototype: quarter_turn_right(rune: Rune): Rune  Prototype Description: It takes a Rune parameter as input and returns a Rune parameter. Example 1: "quarter_turn_right(heart)" rotates the heart shape rune 90 degrees in a clockwise direction. Example 2: "quarter_turn_right(stack(r1, r2))" rotates the output of stack(r1, r2) 90 degrees in a clockwise direction. ]   9. [Function "turn_upside_down" makes a new Rune from a given Rune by turning it upside-down. Function prototype: turn_upside_down(rune: Rune): Rune Prototype Description: It takes a Rune parameter as input and returns a Rune parameter. Example 1: "turn_upside_down(heart)" rotates a heart shape rune 180 degrees in a clockwise direction. Example 2:  "turn_upside_down(stack(r1, r2))" rotates the output of stack(r1, r2) 180 degrees in a clockwise direction.]     You must only use the Runes and functions declared above and avoid importing any module in your program. You can pass the output of each function as input to another function. For example, consider beside(stack(r2, r1), stack(r3, r4)). First, the inner stack functions get executed. r2 goes to the left of r1, and r3 goes to the left of r4. Then the output Rune of each stack works as input of beside function. meaning output of stak(r2, r1) goes on top of output of stack(r3,r4).    Avoid hard coding.   #Programming question# Write a function hook that takes a fraction "frac" as an input and creates a 'hook' pattern. The fraction input determines the size of the base of the hook.   The output rune:   [Imagine a rectangle divided into two horizontal sections. Each section is the height of a square. Top Section: This section is simply a filled square. Bottom Section: The bottom section is also the size of a square. However, it's divided into two equal parts vertically. The left side of this square is filled (so it looks like a rectangle that's half the width of the square). The right side of this square is blank or empty. So, if you place these two sections on top of one another, you get: A full square on top. Directly below it, on the left side, you have a half-filled square (a rectangle), and on the right side, it's empty. This forms a "hook" rune, with the hook part facing to the left. The overall rune is a square with two times the height of the original squares used to create it. Examples: hook(1): It's simply a square rune. hook(0): A filled square at the top. An empty or blank space at the bottom of the same size as the square. hook(1/2): A full square on top. Below that, on the right side, there's another filled square that's half the width of the full square. On the left side, it's empty. hook(1/5): A full square on top. Below that, on the right side, there's a very thin filled rectangle (only 1/5 the width of the square). The rest (4/5) to the right is empty.]   You will only need to use the square and blank primitive runes and transform them to get the hook. Implement your function in the code below:   "function hook(frac) {  // your answer here }   // Test show(hook(1/5));"   #Sample Solution and feedback#   1. "function hook(frac) {  return stack(square,               quarter_turn_right(                    stack_frac(frac, square, blank))); }   // Test show(hook(1/5));" - Great job!   2. "function hook(frac) {    return frac === 1  ? square  : frac === 0  ? stack(square,blank)  : stack(square,beside_frac(1-frac, blank, square));  }    show(hook(1/5));" - Excellent work!   3."function hook(frac) {  return stack(square,      quarter_turn_left(      stack_frac(1-frac, blank, square))); } show(hook(1/5));"   -Great job!   4."function hook(frac) {  // your answer here    return stack_frac(1/2,square,              beside_frac(1-frac,blank,square)); } // Test show(hook(1/5));" -Good job, However stack_frac(1 / 2, etc) could have been simplified by merely using stack.
